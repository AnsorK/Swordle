# SWordle! (Socket-Wordle) üåêüî†
Simulating multiple clients playing Wordle on a server.

## How it works
A server is created to host a Wordle game, and clients are created to connect and play. The server creates a TCP socket to listen for requests, and the client creates a TCP socket to try and connect. Multiple clients can connect and all play concurrently in different threads! Every client gets their own different wordle word.

## Communication
The client sends a guess:

[5 letter word] - 5 bytes

In response the server sends:

['Y' or 'N' if in word list | # or guesses remaining | wordle result] - 8 bytes

The rules of wordle are used: [https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

## How to play
There are 4 commmand-line arguments:

&lt;listener-port&gt; &lt;seed&gt; &lt;word-filename&gt; &lt;num-words&gt;

Representing the server port, seed for random word choosing, the wordle file name, and the number of words in that file, respectively.

Server side w/ arguments: &lt;8192&gt; &lt;117&gt; &lt;word_words.txt&gt; &lt;5757&gt;, compile and run like so:

```bash
gcc -o server.out server.c helper.c -pthread && ./server.out 8192 117 wordle_words.txt 5757
```

Client side, compile and run like so:

```bash
gcc -o client.out client.c && ./client.out
```

## Example
Here is a game with the arguments from above and two clients:
